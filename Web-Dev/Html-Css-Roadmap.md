# CSS 

Considering you have completed the HTML part , now you can start learning CSS

Use the email that has Student benefits to sign up to [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/dashboard/)

Login and start learning CSS from [Here](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/getting-started-css/)

* Then learn all these
    * [InterMediate_HTML_AND_CSS](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/intermediate-html-css/)

    * Once you are done with all the above courses and you are confident enough , you can start learning CSS Frameworks


# CSS Frameworks

CSS Frameworks Include Bootstrap , Tailwind , Materialize , Bulma etc

My suggestion would be to start with Bootstrap and then learn Tailwind.

[Bootstrap_Tutorial](https://youtu.be/Jyvffr3aCp0)

Now you need to learn how to read docs.  So challenge yourself to build a website using tailwind
.

Refer this link

Once you are done with all the above , you can start by cloning a website. Take a website which you feel has a very flawless and highly responsive design. Add your own touch to it and try to make it better.
